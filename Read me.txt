Graduate admissions

This dataset is created for prediction of Graduate Admissions. The dataset comes from Mohan S Acharya, Asfia Armaan,
Aneeta S Antony : A Comparison of Regression Models for Prediction of Graduate Admissions, IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Data Science 2019. It contains several parameters
which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs. The parameters included are : GRE Scores ( out of 340 ), TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 ), University Rating ( out of 5 ),
Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 ), Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 ), Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 ). The output corresponds to the Chance of Admit (ranging from 0 to 1 ). We want to design an algorithm that can predict the chance of admit of a new student using the different mentioned parameters.

Data Oscillator

A parametric oscillator is a driven harmonic oscillator in which the drive energy is provided by varying the parameters of the oscillator, such as the damping or restoring force. A familiar example of parametric
oscillation is "pumping" on a playground swing. Other examples include electrical systems (Series RLC circuits for instance). Estimated the constant parameters of an ordinary differential equation.

Digit dataset

(a) How many classes do we have? How many samples? How many attributes (features)?
(b) Using a K-means algorithm (with 10 clusters), plotted different clusters to run algorithm. Computed the inertia and using the available outputs, computed the homogeneity and the completeness. Compute the Fowlkes-Mallows score. Repeated but with a different initial guess (random). 
(c) Repeated previous problems using the mean shift algorithm and DBSCAN. Play with the different tunable parameters.
